export const Container = () => {

    <div className="main-container">
      <h3>Container</h3>
      <p>This little box is a component called <em>Container</em>, this will be used as the main content area as I keep building on the app. However, for now I will just write down some ideas I have:</p>
      <li>Click the sun to open a menu which helps you navigate the app</li>
      <li>Comparisons to other cities</li>
      <li>Comparison between now and other dates</li>
      <li>Chart showing how the hours of sunlight varies across the year</li>
    </div>
